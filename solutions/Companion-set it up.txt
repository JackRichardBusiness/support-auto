 restarting the Companion device?
If you are using the hotspot setup, make sure to check your WiFi settings and connect to Companion Setup network. Then open your web browser and type in 192.168.1.139/ (the slash is needed) and the setup page should open. If you're using the USB method, make sure there are no blank lines in your companion.txt file. 
Ok, I recommend calling (508) 306-1254 about your problem. Thanks for chatting!
